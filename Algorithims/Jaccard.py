#Jaccard similarity to begin with 
#Find the unions of things and run with that as that can give us case info to begin with


#count is an array


##Assign weights for eac similarity in the union and make it add to 1
##Very rudimentary but can be used to start with

#For example, if there are 4 categories of a man class. Age, height, weight and race a
#and we want ot find out the similarity. We can assign age as .2, weight as .4, hight as .1 and 
#race as .3

#Lets say the boys are boh white, both weight 200 pounds, one is 12 and the other is 16 yo and one is 
# 6 feet and the other is 5 feet

#In this case the similarity will be .7

#This is a super simple example and this should be expanded upon but is a start
